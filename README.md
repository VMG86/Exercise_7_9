# Exercise_7_9
Cleaning code files and practicing with Git

In this exercise you are going to work with your Git repository in order to maintain updated some
C# files.
1. Create a new, public repository called Exercise_7_9
2. You will be provided with 2 C# files that you have to upload to your repository. These C#
files are written wrongly (they don’t follow the clean code rules), although they work.
 One of them (average.cs) calculates the average of a set of marks, until the user types
“end”.
 The other one (digits.cs), calculates how many numbers of 1, 2, 3 or more digits are
entered by the user until he/she types “end”.
3. You will clean one of these files and upload the changes to your repository. (With the
appropriate actions of Git)
4. You will clean the other file and upload the changes to your repository.
5. You will provide the link of your repository in this task delivery, so that we will be able to
see the result of your work and the commits performed.
